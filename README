ATC-radar simulates air trafic controller. More precisly radar-controller. 
You have to rely clearances to pilots. It's not easy, but it's fun.
Basically game should work after downloading. After unzip move all DLL-files visible.
Move DLL-files for example same director as Your binary is or Windows/system32 directory.

Main goal

Purpose of game is rely clearances (instructions) for planes. After clearance plane acts 
like You asked. 

Clearance structure

turn:
	turn [left|right] [heading] directions

altitude:
	climb|descent altitude|flight level 

speed:
	speed amount

approach
	approach

Altitude flight level

Below transition altitude all altitudes is foot. higher than transition level all altitudes is flight levels. 
If transition altitude is 5000 ft and transition level is 55, You say every altitudes in feets until plane receive
first flight level. Example "climb FL 110" is 11 000 ft. Or same situation but descending plane below 5000 ft.
Example as well is descent 4500 ft.
